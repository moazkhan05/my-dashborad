# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Bootstrap library
Bootsrtap is a framework of CSS that used for styling 
we can import it and use in our react apps 

installation : npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

#### FusionCharts
As we all know that we need data for product labels , organization reports
to represent data and data visualizations, 
we usually use Charts , diagrams for representing data

Here FusionCharts comes, FusionCharts is a package that can be used in react apps / other javascript apps as well  to represent data
Other packages are also there to represent data

installation :  npm install fusioncharts react-fusioncharts --save

After installing the fusioncharts components, you can replace the code in App.js file with the code shown in the steps below to create your first chart. Import all the required dependencies to get started.

// Step 1 - Include react
import React from "react";

// Step 2 - Include the react-fusioncharts component
import ReactFC from "react-fusioncharts";

// Step 3 - Include the fusioncharts library
import FusionCharts from "fusioncharts";

// Step 4 - Include the chart type
import Column2D from "fusioncharts/fusioncharts.charts";

// Step 5 - Include the theme as fusion
import FusionTheme from "fusioncharts/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion";

// Step 6 - Adding the chart and theme as dependency to the core fusioncharts
ReactFC.fcRoot(FusionCharts, Column2D, FusionTheme);
